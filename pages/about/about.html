            <h1>About Us!</h1>
            <p>
                At Polar Platter, we believe cold food should be truly cold—not just “chilly,” but dramatically, unnecessarily
                cold. Why
                settle for a lukewarm spoonful of ice cream when your utensils could be scientifically unsettling?
                <br><br>
                Founded by people who took refrigeration way too seriously, we design advanced dining solutions that push the
                boundaries
                of temperature control. Whether you’re looking to enhance your frozen treats, experiment with extreme cooling,
                or just
                wonder what happens when you take thermal regulation too far, we’ve got you covered.

                <h2>Q&A</h2>
                <div class="qna-section">
                    <p class="question">Q: Is this safe to use?</p>
                    <p class="answer">A: Mostly! While expertly designed (probably), our products have been known to freeze food a
                        little too well, solidify drinks unexpectedly, and occasionally surprise even us. Use with mild caution.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="qna-section">
                    <p class="question">Q: How does the cooling work?</p>
                    <p class="answer">A: Through advanced chilling technology (and a bit of recklessness), our system keeps your utensils colder than common sense would suggest. Where the heat goes? Not our problem.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="qna-section">
                    <p class="question">Q: Will this make my food taste better?</p>
                    <p class="answer">A: Technically, no—but it will make your meals colder than necessary, which is kind of the same thing. If you’ve ever wished your ice cream was shockingly frigid or your sushi felt fresh off an iceberg, you’re in luck.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="qna-section">
                    <p class="question">Q: What if something goes wrong?</p>
                    <p class="answer">A: In the rare case of unexpected frost events, simply stop using it, place the device in a safe location, and pretend this was intentional.</p>

                <div class="qna-section">
                    <p class="question">Q: Do you offer refunds?</p>
                    <p class="answer">A: Refunds are available only if the product hasn’t permanently altered your kitchen’s temperature.</p>
